  "About": {
    "paragraph": "During my college days, I was very attracted to web applications because I wanted to understand the functionalities of a website and was curious to learn how a website could appear so interactive and responsive and how the backend operations take place.This led me to choosing full stack web development as my path. So, I joined Masai School and became a competitive programmer and a full-stack web developer.Now, I have hands-on experience in building websites and web applications. I specialize in JavaScript. As a Full-Stack web developer, I want to meet the requirements of the mocks and fulfill the user stories and make CRED operations for building user-friendly and dynamic websites.",
